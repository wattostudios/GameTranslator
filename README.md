## About Game Translator
When a game is being developed, typically only 1 language is used by the development team. In
some cases, the developers will also build translations for some other major languages, however
this is not common for several reasons...
* It complicates the development of the game
* It costs time and money to do the translation, both of which are limited
* Often the costs outway the benefit, as games in alternate languages don't sell well

There are several groups on the internet that address this issue by providing translations for
games. However, it can often be hindered because the languages are hard to find,or use a
proprietary file format. What this means is that translations are slow, and a programmer needs
to be involved to translate the files back and forward.

Game Translator, following in the footsteps of Game Extractor, provides a simple interface for
translating a number of games into different languages. Through the use of plugins, it can
easily support new games, and the common interface makes for faster and more efficient
translations.

Furthermore, Game Translator can be used by anyone who wants to change the language in a game,
such as changing the names of enemy teams, and renaming players, weapons, or cars.
